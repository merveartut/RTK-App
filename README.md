# RTK-App

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project serves as a practical implementation and demonstration of **RTK Query** (part of Redux Toolkit). It illustrates how to leverage RTK Query for streamlined data fetching, caching, and state management in a modern React application.

The goal is to provide a clean, working example of defining an API service, handling various CRUD operations, and managing loading and error states with minimal boilerplate code.

## ✨ Features

* **Efficient Data Fetching:** Utilizes RTK Query's automated fetching and caching capabilities.
* **Automatic State Management:** Global state management for API data is handled automatically by RTK Query.
* **TypeScript Support:** Built with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
* **Modern Tooling:** Uses Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.
